# apply_desifootprint_nz
This is the script to apply desi footprint and n(z) on the output from Yuuki's full sky light cones

To run the notebook on NERSC jupyler, you should switch the kernal to DESI master

To run the script directly, you should first "source /global/common/software/desi/desi_environment.sh 19.12" (I have not tested it yet).
