# apply_desifootprint_nz

## multi_box2desi_cutsky_nz.py

This script applies desi footprint and n(z) on the output from Yuuki's full sky light cones.

It consumes a configuration file very similar to the one used by Yuuki's light cone code.

The file job_postprocess.sh has an example job file, to be submitted via sbatch.

See the file config.ini for configuration options. I've run it within desi environment version 19.12.
